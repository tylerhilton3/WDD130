            What makes this better than other to-do list apps that also have a sync feature?
        </div>
        <div class="a">
            This application has a unique framework that computes the ideal ranking of all your tasks. While other applications 
            might be able to sync across platforms and devices, ours clearly has the upperhand when it comes to precision and
             raw time saving.

        <div class="q">
            What kind of information does the engine require?
        </div>
        <div class="a">
            The engine first asks for 2 lists: a list of tasks, and then a list of categories in your life. It then asks you to assign
             each task to a category. Then it asks you to rank each category based on how important that category is right now in your 
             life. Given only that information, it will output a clean, organized and prioritized list of tasks.

            How will I be able to sync my information across devices?
        </div>
        <div class="a">
            Once the engine is finished, not only will there be an account feature added, but there will be a downloadable application. 
            Just download the app on your devices and your information automatically will sync. You will also be able to view your created
             lists, list of tasks, and history from the website as well, once you're signed in.

            When will the engine be finished?

        <div class="a">
            The engine will be finished sometime in the coming years, depending on the availability of the lead developer. We hope that
            you'll consider following us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter so you can be updated on new features, beta releases, and
            much more.
